# Satella Jailed

For, um, educational purposes only or something. Definitely *don't* use this to pirate in-app purchases in apps to which you don't have legal rights.

A modern in-app purchase cracker built for sideloaded applications, especially on unjailbroken devices. If you want to crack in-app purchases on jailbroken devices, including for sideloaded apps, try [Satella 2][1]

## Manual Method

1. Obtain a *decrypted* .ipa of your target app
2. Install ESign from ipa.cypwn.xyz
3. Share the .ipa and Satella\_Jailed.zip to ESign
4. Sign the decrypted .ipa with the contents of Satella\_Jailed.zip imported
5. Install the patched .ipa

## AppDB Method

1. Link your device to [AppDB][2] 
2. Enable the in-app purchase patch
3. Install an app that has in-app purchases

Now you can make fake purchases without a jailbreak! Just attempt a purchase and cancel on the popup. You can also access Satella Jailedâ€™s preferences by long-pressing with two fingers inside an app if you are on iOS 13 or higher.
