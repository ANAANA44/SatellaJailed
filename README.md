# Satella Jailed

A modern in-app purchase cracker built for sideloaded applications, especially on unjailbroken devices. If you want to crack in-app purchases on jailbroken devices, including for sideloaded apps, try [Satella 2][1]

How to use:
1. Download Satella.dylib from here
2. Install iPAPatcher or similar
3. Obtain a **decrypted** .ipa of your target app
4. Patch the .ipa to include Satella.dylib
5. Sideload onto your device using AltStore, Sideloadly, whatever
6. Attempt to make an in-app purchase, then cancel on the popup

Please note that Satella does not work on server-sided purchases. If it doesn’t work, chances are that I can’t fix it. You can use the included TestApp.ipa if you want to ensure that Satella Jailed is functional.

Thanks to ZonD80 for the suggestion to port Satella to jailed devices, and to the CyPwn admins and shouri10 for testing on iOS 15\~
