# Satella Jailed

For, um, educational purposes only or something. Definitely *don't* use this to pirate in-app purchases in apps to which you don't have legal rights.

A modern in-app purchase cracker built for sideloaded applications, especially on unjailbroken devices. If you want to crack in-app purchases on jailbroken devices, including for sideloaded apps, try [Satella 2][1]

How to use:
1. Download Satella.dylib from here
2. Obtain a **decrypted** .ipa of your target app
3. Patch the .ipa to include Satella.dylib. This can be done in Sideloadly or iPAPatcher
4. Sideload onto your device using the service of your choice (if you don’t have one, try Sideloadly)
5. Attempt to make an in-app purchase, then cancel on the popup

Alternatively:
1. Link your device to [AppDB][2] 
2. Enable the in-app purchase patch and install an app
3. Attempt to make an in-app purchase, then cancel on the popup

Please note that Satella does not work on server-sided purchases. If it doesn’t work, chances are that I can’t fix it. You can use the included TestApp.ipa if you want to ensure that Satella Jailed is functional.

Thanks to ZonD80 for the suggestion to port Satella to jailed devices, to the CyPwn admins and shouri10 for testing on iOS 15, and to AppDB for including Satella in their signing service\~
